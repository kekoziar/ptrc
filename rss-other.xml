	<description>For this month's K-12 education webinar, join the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and STEMis ED for a professional development session for educators on Tuesday, May 28 from 6-7 p. m. ET. Education experts Kathy Hoppe and Christine Lawlor-King, both former educators with more than 30 years of combined experience in the classroom, will introduce the mini invention challenge as a way to integrate invention across diverse content areas. In the mini invention challenge, students discover how invention leads to exploration, creativity, and experimentation. They learn to generate ideas, prototype solutions, and effectively communicate their findings. By harnessing the power of invention, teachers can create a culture of innovation that empowers students to become active participants in shaping their future.

	<description>Trade secrets play an important role in firm competitiveness and strategic positioning, especially for startups and in research and development&#38;#8212;intensive industries. Firms should actively prevent unauthorized disclosures of trade secrets. In case of a theft, they may need to pursue enforcement. Protecting trade secrets is an ongoing challenge for companies doing business in the United States and the People's Republic of China. Join us at United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, for an examination of enforcement avenues against trade secret misappropriation in the United States and China. This half-day, in-person program will bring together experts on civil options and administrative enforcement, including representatives of China's State Administration for Market Regulation, the Shanghai Administration for Market Regulation, and civil litigators from the private sector. Panels will examine the following topics, and take questions from the audience: Trade secret protection: Legislative work, government service, and administrative enforcement Civil enforcement against trade secret misappropriation: Investigation and evidence-gathering, role of private parties, case transfer, and case presentation The program is free, but advance registration is required. Due to space limitations, we recommend you register early. This is an in-person program only. There is no virtual attendance option. Register today Agenda A detailed agenda will be posted to this page prior to the program date. Additional information Presentations will be in English and Mandarin. Simultaneous interpretation will be available to all attendees. For more information, visit the registration page or email william. long@uspto.gov in the USPTO's Office of Policy and International Affairs (OPIA). This program is organized by OPIA in collaboration with China's State Administration for Market Regulation. This program is hosted by the USPTO's Global Intellectual Property Academy, a unit of OPIA. The office advises the administration and other federal government departments and agencies on domestic and international intellectual property (IP), legal, and policy issues. It also provides technical assistance and training on IP-related matters to U.S. stakeholders, and U.S. and foreign government officials. </description>
