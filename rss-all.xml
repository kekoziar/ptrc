	<description>Trade secrets play an important role in firm competitiveness and strategic positioning, especially for startups and in research and development&#38;#8212;intensive industries. Firms should actively prevent unauthorized disclosures of trade secrets. In case of a theft, they may need to pursue enforcement. Protecting trade secrets is an ongoing challenge for companies doing business in the United States and the People's Republic of China.

This half-day, in-person program will bring together experts on civil options and administrative enforcement, including representatives of China's State Administration for Market Regulation, the Shanghai Administration for Market Regulation, and civil litigators from the private sector. Panels will examine the following topics, and take questions from the audience: Trade secret protection: Legislative work, government service, and administrative enforcement Civil enforcement against trade secret misappropriation: Investigation and evidence-gathering, role of private parties, case transfer, and case presentation The program is free, but advance registration is required. Due to space limitations, we recommend you register early. This is an in-person program only. There is no virtual attendance option. Register today Agenda A detailed agenda will be posted to this page prior to the program date. Additional information Presentations will be in English and Mandarin.
